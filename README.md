# Magic Leap Toolkit

Magic Leap Toolkit provides developers with a set of useful tools that solve specific real-world problems or to extend functionality for developing Magic Leap apps. Our goal is to provide a collection of reusable assets, engine prefabs, and tools you can add to your projects.
Magic Leap Toolkit is for Magic Leap developers working in UnityÂ® Software with a specific problem or need they want to address in their apps. Tools can help with problems like network-connecting devices or viewing log files while your app is running.
